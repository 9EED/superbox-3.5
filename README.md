  This is a fully functional pixelsim game I made completly from scratch in Python and raylib. It is the third iteration of the superbox series. The game is essentially a sandbox where you can create and destroy pixels of deffirent materials that interact with each other, in many ways such as burning, melting, freezing, exploding. the 3.5 version of the game is the first to feature a GUI and a save system in addition to an "endless" world.
